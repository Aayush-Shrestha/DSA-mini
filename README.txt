1. unzip the folder
2. run the all.py file
3. Among the 3 algortihms select the one needed
4. if selected Dijktra'a algorithm: The starting node is on the top left side of the window.
                                    To select the end node click the right button of the mouse and hover over the node to select the node as the end node.
                                    To draw walls click the left button and drag the cursor for continuous stretch of the wall.
                                    To again draw wall on other side of the window leave the left mouse button and repeat the step just above.
                                    To run the program press the "spacebar" key and "c" to clear the window for retrail of the same algorithm.
                                    To exit to main window press backspace key.
5. if selected A* algorithm: First select the starting node by pressing left mouse button and then select the end node by pressing the left button
                             Make wall as desired by clicking the left mouse button and dragging it along the nodes.
                             To run the program press "spacebar" key and "c" to clear the window for retrail of the same algorithm.
                             To exit to main window press backspace key.
6.if selected ant colony: First select 8 nodes by clicking left mouse button.
                          To run the program press "spacebar" key and "c" to clear the window for retrail of the same algorithm.
                          To exit to main window press backspace key.
